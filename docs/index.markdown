**PhD student at the CTU in Prague.<br>Focus on routing and mutli-goal path planning.**

I am 2nd year PhD student at the Czech Technical University in Prague. 
I work in the Computational Robotics Laboratory with the Articial Inteligence Center in Faculty of Electrical Engineer. 
My main focus is on the routing problems, the optimal solution of these problems and solution in dynamic environments.

Besides, one of my hobbies is popularization of science. I have a podcast with my friend Míša called *Věda bez cenzury* where we talk about doctorate studies, academia, and science.
